# palace-game

Palace is a fun card game for 2-5 players. The basic rules are fairly simple.

You must play cards in a discard pile using ascending order, and the first player to run out of cards wins.

The fun happens when you or someone else is forced to pick up the discard pile because you can't play. A few other rules add an extra level to the game, as you can use strategy to get ahead!

#Setting Up The Game

1. Draw cards to see who will go first. Person with highest card becomes dealer. Person to the left of the dealer goes first
2. Reshuffle deck
3. Deal 3 cards to each player face-down
4. Deal each person 6 cards to hold (players should keep these to themselves)
5. Each player then chooses to place 3 face-up on your face down cards [Typically choose to place higher cards on top]
6. Place remainder of cards in middle of draw pile (face down)

#Playing the game

1. Turn over 1 card from the draw pile to make the discard pile. Player to the left of the dealer will play on it to begin the game
   2.Play cards in ascending order on the start card (card must be equal to or higher and of the same rank)
   3.Draw up to 3 cards in your hand after playing. You need to pick up enough cards from the draw pile to make it
2. If you cannot play(no card equal or higher than the discard pile), you must pick up the discard pile. The net person has their turn and can play any card
3. Move on to the person on the left(clockwise)
   6.Use 2s and 10s as wild cards [2: resets the discard pile to number 2,10 removes the entire discard pile]
4. Clear the discard pile if 4 of a kind is played in a row. Last player who played the last card can play any card.

#Ending the Game

1. The draw pile must be emptied
2. Next, play until your hand runs out. If you can’t play you still have to pick up the discard pile and put it in your hand
3. During a player’s turn without a draw pile and don’t have a hand, play one card from the face-up cards, if you have multiple cards of the same rank like 2 Jacks, you can play them both at the same time
4. After the face up cards are all utilized, play the face-down cards. If it plays on the current card by being equal or higher, it can be played. If not you must pick up the entire discard pile.
5. Play all of your cards first to win
